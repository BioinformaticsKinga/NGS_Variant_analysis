# Pipeline for Genetic Variant Detection and Annotation

# Project Overview
This project outlines a bioinformatics workflow for processing raw sequencing data, identifying genetic variants, and annotating them with relevant biological insights. By integrating widely used bioinformatics tools, the pipeline ensures efficient data preprocessing, alignment, variant calling, and annotation, providing a structured approach to variant analysis.

# Key Objectives
Enhance sequencing data quality through preprocessing and quality control.

Identify genomic variants such as structural alterations and small indels.

Annotate variants to determine their biological and clinical significance.

Generate visual insights for better data interpretation and presentation.

# Pipeline Stages and Tools
1. Sequencing Data Quality Assessment (FASTQC)
Raw sequencing reads (FASTQ files) undergo a quality control check using FASTQC to identify potential sequencing errors, adapter contamination, and low-quality regions.

2. Read Optimization and Cleaning (Trimmomatic)
Low-quality bases and adapter sequences are filtered out using Trimmomatic, ensuring that only high-confidence reads proceed to the next stage.

3. Read Alignment to Reference Genome (BWA)
Preprocessed reads are aligned to a reference genome using BWA, mapping them to their correct genomic locations for further analysis.

4. Data Formatting and Optimization (Samtools)
The alignment data is converted from SAM to BAM format, sorted, and indexed using Samtools, making it more efficient for variant detection.

5. Variant Identification (DELLY)
Genomic variations, including structural variants and small insertions/deletions (indels), are detected using DELLY, which enables precise identification of genomic rearrangements.

6. Functional Variant Annotation (ANNOVAR)
The detected variants are annotated using ANNOVAR, linking them to affected genes, known pathogenic mutations, and potential functional consequences.

7. Data Visualization and Reporting (R, ggplot2)
Final results are visualized using R and ggplot2, enabling clear representation of variant distributions, predicted impacts, and potential disease relevance.

# Results and Findings
Preprocessing significantly improved sequencing quality, reducing errors and enhancing mapping accuracy.

Variant detection successfully identified structural and small-scale mutations, providing a comprehensive view of genomic changes.

Annotation provided functional insights into detected variants, assisting in their biological interpretation.

Visualizations facilitated an intuitive understanding of variant distribution, making results accessible for further analysis.
